Statistics to gather for a "packagist distribution":
- Dependencies appearing in composer.json's per module/plugin, across D7, D8, WP
- Dependencies of dependencies (fully resolved) for each module, to get complete set of packages. 
- Number of sites using each module/plugin that has 1+ packagist dependency.


Approach:
---------
Data model SqLite DB with:

project (id, cms, name, num_sites)
package (id, name)
project_package(project_id, package_id, is_direct)


To obtain module/plugin dependencies for D7/D8,
- Download Drupal.org releases.tsv dataset: https://drupal.org/files/releases.tsv
- For the first of each unique {project_machine_name,api}, try to download
  http://cgit.drupalcode.org/{project_machine_name}/plain/composer.json?h={version}
- If composer.json is present,
  * Fetch usage statistics, assign the project an entry in project table
  * Record each required package from the composer.json in package / project_package as direct.
  * Create a clean composer configuration in which we composer require drupal/{project_machine_name}
  * For each non- "drupal/" package in composer.lock, record to package / project_package as indirect.

 > When reporting number of sites needing a dependency, just count number of D8 sites for dependencies
   of Drupal 8 core, don't re-count sites for every module.
